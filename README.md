# Open Source Software contributed by the Public sector in Luxembourg, a list of organization accounts

This page presents the list of organization or group accounts where the public sector in Luxembourg publishes its source code as open source.

Currently we only manage accounts hosted on github.com, gitlab.com or Gitlab forges.

- [accounts-public-sector.yml](accounts-public-sector.yml) : list of accounts in YAML. Each account has an URL and the following attributes:
    -   `service_of` : the organisation which owns the account. It is possible to list several organizations.
    -   `floss_policy` : the link towards the FLOSS policy of the account. 
- [platforms.csv](platforms.csv): this CSV file enables to associate the URL of a forge with a platform. This is for example required for self-hosted Gitlab forges.

# Open Data

These files are processed by [codegouvfr-fetch-data](https://git.sr.ht/~etalab/codegouvfr-fetch-data) and the resulting data is regularly uploaded on the [Open Data Portal](https://data.public.lu):
